## Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project based on employee data from the AMCAT dataset. The analysis covers various features such as job roles, cities, academic performance, gender, and salaries, aiming to uncover key insights about job placement and compensation trends.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:

1. Perform data cleaning and transformation to prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. Explore the relationships between employee attributes (e.g., job title, location, academic scores, gender) and salary.
3. Generate visualizations that highlight key trends in the data.
4. Provide actionable insights to guide HR and management in employee placement and salary structuring.

## Key Insights

1. Salary Distribution: A wide salary range is observed across different job titles, with senior roles earning significantly higher.
2. Impact of Academic Scores: Academic performance plays a role in determining salary and job roles, particularly in technical positions.
3. Gender and City-wise Analysis: There are disparities in salary distribution between male and female employees, and cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad show higher average salaries.
4. Correlation between Experience and Salary: A strong correlation exists between tenure and salary growth, suggesting that experience is a key factor in determining compensation.

## Conclusion
The EDA on this dataset reveals key patterns in how factors like job role, location, gender, academic performance, and experience affect salaries. These insights can be used by organizations to structure compensation more effectively and make data-driven decisions for employee placement.
